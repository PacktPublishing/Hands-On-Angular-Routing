## About the Video Course
This course is a simple way to get started with Angular Router and harness its full power for your applications. By using Angular Router, you’ll activate all the required Angular components to compose a page when a user navigates to a certain URL. You’ll learn to set up routing so that it lets users navigate from one page to another without page reload. Instead, it updates the browser’s history so the user can use the back and forward buttons when navigating between pages.
